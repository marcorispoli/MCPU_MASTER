.SH "Index"
.PP
.SH "Abstract"
.PP
This section describes the implementation of the modules controlling the \fBGantry\fP Motors
.SH "Overview"
.PP
The \fBGantry\fP system controls five motorizations in order to accomplish with the system requirements:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Motor controlling the C-ARM Vertical position;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Motor controlling the Body position;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Motor controlling the C-ARM rotation (projections);
.IP "\(bu" 2
Motor controlling the C-ARM sliding;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Motor controlling the Tube-Arm (Tilting) rotation;
.PP

.PP
All the Motors are based on the same controlling interface:
.IP "\(bu" 2
CANOpen standard interface\&.
.PP

.PP
The Application implements a Base shared module that all the controller inherit\&.

.PP
This shared module, implement the common features that all the activation requires:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Implements the CANOpen protocol stack:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Handles the connection with the motor device;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Handles the CiA404 status machine;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Handles the control of the motor register parameters;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Handles the control of the motor activation;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Handles the Fault management;
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Implements the basic activation functions;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Manual Activation mode;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Automatic Activation mode;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Automatic Zero Setting procedure;
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Implements the basic safety functions;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Manage the activation timeouts;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Manage the obstacle detection;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Manage the diagnostic on the position sensor;
.PP

.PP

.PP
The communication with the Motor Drivers makes use of the USB to CAN converter device, that the application handles with a dedicated internal process, providing an application common interface to send and receive frames from the CAN bus\&.
.SH "Common Features Description"
.PP
.SS "Motor Internal Status"
The Motor internal status machine is managed so that the Application can have a feedback on the current working status\&.

.PP
A common status description helps the Application to provide a standard front-end when requesting to activate one of the available motors\&.

.PP
Actually the standard internal status flags are (\fBstatus_options\fP):
.IP "\(bu" 2
NOT_CONNECTED: the dirver is not connected to the Can Bus (maybe off, disconnected);
.IP "\(bu" 2
MOTOR_CONFIGURATION: this is the startup fase;
.IP "\(bu" 2
MOTOR_READY: the motor is ready to process activations;
.IP "\(bu" 2
MOTOR_BUSY: an activation is pending;
.IP "\(bu" 2
MOTOR_FAULT: the Motor is in Fault condition

.PP
NOTE: The motor fault condition it is not necessarily a System fault\&. For example, during a compression the motor power supply is switched off for safety reason, and the motor device activate amn internal fault due to the missing power supply\&.
.PP
.SS "Motor Device Connection"
The initial startup fase is commonly handled by the Base module in order to establish a valid connection with the target motor device\&.

.PP
During the startup fase:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Can connection is established;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Motor is configured (see the Motor Device Configuration section) with a set of common registers;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Every Motor is configured with a subset of registers that depend by the target motor;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The current motor position is initialized (either if it is an external sensor or the device internal incremental encoder);
.PP

.PP
The Startup fase never ends until the previous steps are not successfully completed\&.

.PP
When the startup fase completes successfully, the application base module handle the internal status machine so that it is automatically set to Ready status\&.

.PP
In the event of fault condition, the application tries automatically to reset the fault as soon as the fault event disappear\&.
.SS "Motor Device Configuration"
There are basically three kind of motor configurations:
.IP "\(bu" 2
the motor control setup;
.IP "\(bu" 2
the basic motor configuration;
.IP "\(bu" 2
the performance of the motor activations\&.
.PP
.SS "Motor Control Setup"
The motor can be configured to use an external sensor or the internal Encoder:
.IP "\(bu" 2
If the motor is configured with the internal encoder:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
the position is initialized reading the actual position stored into the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
the current position is then totally internally managed be the motor device;
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
If the motor is configured with the external sensor:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
the position is initialized reading the external sensor and initializing the internal encoder with the sensor;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
external sensor (potentiometer) shall be calibrated;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
the calibrated parameters are stored into the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP;
.PP

.PP
See the Position contro section for detail\&.
.PP

.PP
During the startup fase every Motor can upload (if needed) a special program (Nano-J application) running inside the device for special functions\&.

.PP
See the detail of every motor description\&.
.SS "Basic Motor Configurations"
Every motor sets its own subset of parameters to tune the reaction of that motor propery, with respect of the mechanical asset and its required performances\&.

.PP
The parameters that usually are set into this fase are:

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Maximum Current per fase;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Maximum speed;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Maximum acceleration;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Position limits;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The PID parameters;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The GPIO configuration;
.PP

.PP
During the Startup fase, every implemented motor controller is requested to upload its subset of registers\&.
.SS "Performances"
Every motor can set its own performances reading the content of the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP\&.

.PP
The following parameters can dinamically be configured:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Automatic activation speed, acceleration, deceleration parameters;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Manual activation speed, acceleration, deceleration parameters;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Automatic (if necessary) Zero setting speed and acceleration;
.PP

.PP
Those parameters can be changed runtime after the application is compiled\&.
.SS "Position Handling"
Every motor control can be configured to use only the internal incremental encoder or an external potentiometer, connected to the Analog Input of the motor device\&.

.PP
See the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP description for details\&.
.SS "Internal Incremental Encoder Mode"
When the motor control setup is set to use only the internal encoder, the actual position is handled internally by the motor device\&.

.PP
Because the internal position is reset after every power off, in order to keep a valid absolute position, after every activation completion, the actual position is stored into the \fBMotorConfig:\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
During the startup fase, the actual position is then retrived from the configuration file\&.
.PP

.PP
In case of file corruption, first istallation, or whenever the position should be considered no more valid, a special automatic or manual zero setting procedure can be requested:
.IP "\(bu" 2
a new valid actual position is then acquiored and stored into the configuration file\&.
.PP

.PP
See the Zero Setting Management section for details\&.
.SS "External Position Sensor"
If the motor control is configured to make use of an external position sensor as a reference, this sensor is used in the startup fase in order to initialize the internal encoder with the actual absolute position\&.

.PP
The position then will be handled as in the Internal Incremental Encoder Mode\&.

.PP
In order to be used, however, the external sensor position shall be calibrated:
.IP "\(bu" 2
the calibration consists to store the sensor readout value corresponding to the virtual zero position\&.
.PP

.PP
The calibration is executed with a proper panel in the Service Tool (see the related documentation)\&.

.PP
Without a valid calibration, the motor module sets a proper Warning message, preventing any operative activation (but enabling the Service Activation for service purpose)\&.
.SS "Fault Management"
Every motor control module handles the Faults signalled by the Motor Device\&.

.PP
An active Fault status always prevents to activate the given motorization\&.

.PP
The Application reads the current fault code from the remote motor device, logging it into the Gantry\&.log file:
.IP "\(bu" 2
A generic application Warning message will be activated and displayed in the Message Panel Window;
.PP

.PP
The application automatically will retry to exits from the Fault status:
.IP "\(bu" 2
in the case the fault condition should clear, the normal motor operation will be restored\&.
.PP

.PP
If a Fault condition should happen during any activation mode, the activation will be quickly aborted\&.
.SS "Obstacle Detection"
Every motor controller share the same mechanism to handle the obstacle detection:
.IP "\(bu" 2
the Application, based on the current operating mode, assignes the obstacle triggers to the current motor ativated\&.
.PP

.PP
When the obstacle is triggered, if a motor is activated immediatelly stops\&.

.PP
The Obstacle detection is active only for the Automatic activations\&. 
.PP
.nf
NOTE: the manual activation, for its intrinsic safety, doesn't require the obstacle detection\&.

.fi
.PP

.PP
See the specific Motor function section for detailed description about the obstacle detection\&.
.SS "Manual Activation Button management"
Every motor control module inherits a shared mechanism to check the activation of system IOs that the Application, in a similar way as it mades for the obstacle triggers, assignes to be a manual activation triggers\&.

.PP
During every operating status, the motor control checks the status of the manual triggers, and if they are enabled by the application, they causes the following reaction:
.IP "\(bu" 2
If the motor is in Idle, a manual activation is started;
.IP "\(bu" 2
If the motor is running with an automatic activation, the activation stops;
.PP

.PP
The Application may enable or disable the manual triggers individually for any motor based on the current operating contest\&.

.PP
See the description of the given motor control for details\&.
.SS "Customization preparation and termination procedures"
Every motor controller module inherits a shared method to customize the activation preparation and termination:

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
During the preparation of the motor activation, just after having applied the torque, the controller module of the activating motor receives a call to a special function in order to let that module to prepare for the activation: for example in case of stationary brake, it has to be released before to start\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The similar method is used to terminates an activation: just before to remove the torque, the controller of the terminating motor receives a call to a specific termination procedure: in the case of the brakes, for example, the stationary brake shall be activated\&.
.PP

.PP
See the specific motor function implementation for details\&.
.SS "Automatic Position Activation"
Every motor inherits this basic activation mode\&.

.PP
The Automatic activation allows the motor control module to set a particolar target, to set the activation parameters (speed, acceleration, deceleration) and to wait for the command completion\&.

.PP
During the activation:
.IP "\(bu" 2
if the obstacle is detected, the activation quickly stops;
.IP "\(bu" 2
if the manual activation is triggered, the activation quickly stops;
.IP "\(bu" 2
If a fault condition is detected, the activation quickly stops;
.PP

.PP
The activation successfully termines when:
.IP "\(bu" 2
the motor device detect the target position;
.IP "\(bu" 2
the control module detects that the current position is in an acceptable target range for almost one second;

.PP
NOTE: although the motor device should handle the activation completion, the module always check the current position to prevent a system lock if the motor driver should fail in monitoring the target range\&.
.PP

.PP
There are two type of automatic activations:
.IP "\(bu" 2
an automatic starting activation: the motor starts running after motor preparation;
.IP "\(bu" 2
a nano-j start: the motor is prepared for the activation, and a special program is loaded into the motor\&. The program, should activate the motor when the start condition are detected\&.
.PP

.PP
See the specific motor function implementation for details\&.
.SS "Manual Position Activation"
Every motor controller inherits the the Manual position activation mode\&.

.PP
The manual position activate the motor when the manual activation triggers are detected active\&.

.PP
The direction of motor rotation is assigned by the application to the triggers\&.

.PP
The motor will continue to run until:
.IP "\(bu" 2
the limit position is detected;
.IP "\(bu" 2
the manual trigger are released;
.IP "\(bu" 2
the manual triggers of the opposed direction is activated;
.PP
.SS "Zero Setting Management"
The controller modules inherit the procedure to initialize the absolute position to a known mechanical position\&.

.PP
There are two zero setting procedures:
.IP "\(bu" 2
the zero setting procedure with the external trigger;
.IP "\(bu" 2
the zero setting istant procedure, without motor rotation;
.PP
.SS "Zero setting automatic procedure with external trigger"
This procedure makes use of an external trigger, usually a photocell, in order to detect the mechanical zero position\&.

.PP
When the procedure is activated, the motor starts rotating until detect the trigger activation\&. The activation immediatelly termines and the actual position is updated with the real mechanical position\&. The current position is then stored into the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP file\&.

.PP
During the zero setting activation:
.IP "\(bu" 2
the obstacle detection is monitored: the zero setting is aborted in the case they should detected;
.IP "\(bu" 2
the manual activatin triggers are monitored: the zero setting is aborted in the case they should detected;

.PP
NOTE: during the zero setting procedure, the limit position register is ignored\&.
.PP
.SS "Zero setting istant procedure"
This procedure can be activated when the current absolute position is known: the encoder is istantly initialized with the actual position, without to start the rotation\&.

.PP
This procedure is internally used by the innher module of every motor controller in case it is using an external position sensor: in this case, at the startup, the actual position is provided by the current value of the sensor\&.

.PP
.SH "C-ARM Rotation Description"
.PP
.SS "Abstract"
This section describes the feature of the C-ARM motor control\&. The section describes in detail the performances, the activation modes, and the limitations\&.
.SS "Overview"
The \fBGantry\fP provides the C-ARM rotation tool mainly to allow the operator to select a projection for an incoming exposure\&.

.PP
The projection selection is a mandatory condition to proceed with an exposure (with few exceptions)\&.

.PP
The only method to select a projection is through the AWS command\&. (see the AWS protocol documentation \fBEXEC_ArmPosition\fP)\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
Although the projection can be solely selected by the AWS, a manual activation is always permitted for a limited angle range, pressing the manual buttons\&.
.RE
.PP
When the C-ARM is activated in automatic mode the Vertical motor is activated subsequently to keep the height of the patient compression plane unchanged (Virtual Isocentric feature)\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The Virtual isocentric correction is activated only with the AWS command\&. The manual position doesn't change the Vertical ARM position\&.
.RE
.PP
The current ARM angle and selected projection is displayed on the \fBGantry\fP Display\&.

.PP
A Safety startegy is iplemented in order to prevent accidental activation or impacts\&.
.SS "Performances"
The C-ARM is controlled with a precision of 0\&.01 degree\&. Although such precision, an Automatic activation with the AWS protocol command can only set a target angle with only 1 degree of resolution\&.

.PP
The C-ARM rotation range is: -180 to 180\&.

.PP
The actual rotation speed can be changed in the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP file:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Automatic Acceleration, Deceleration and Speed can be set;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Manual Acceleration, Deceleration and Speed can be set;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Service Acceleration and Speed(for zero setting procedure) can be set;
.PP
.SS "Position Calibration"
The current position of the C-ARM is provided by an high resolution encoder embedded into the intelligent motor driver:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The initial position, after the system power on, is provided by the MCPU that read it from the configuration file;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The actual position is then saved into the configuration file after any activation completion;
.PP

.PP
In the event of data lost or corrupted position, the correct position can be restored with an automatic or manual calibration procedure:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Automatic calibration position makes use of a zero position photocell;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The manual procedure allows to manually move the ARM to the correct zero position;
.PP

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
After the first istallation it is mandatory to execute the zero position calibration before to make the ARM available for the automatic activations\&. In this case a WARNING message is generated by the MCPU\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Automatic C-ARM Positioning"
The AWS can select a target projection with a proper protocol command (\fBEXEC_ArmPosition\fP)\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The projection selection is mandatory to enable an exposure\&. After any exposure, the current projection is invalidated and the AWS shall set it ones more in order to proceed with a new exposure\&.
.RE
.PP
The Command will set:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The projection name;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The target Angle;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The acceptable position range;
.PP
.SS "Projection Name"
The Projection name refers to one of the possible selectable projections:

.PP
PROJECTION FOR 2D   PROJECTION FOR 3D   PROJECTION FOR CESM   PROJECTION FOR COMBO   PROJECTION FOR VI    LCC   LCCT   LCCD   LCCB   LCCM    LFB   LFBT   LFBD   LFBB   LFBM    LISO   LISOT   LISOD   LISOB   LISOM    LLM   LLMT   LLMD   LLMB   LLMM    LLMO   LLMOT   LLMOD   LLMOB   LLMOM    LML   LMLT   LMLD   LMLB   LMLM    LMLO   LMLOT   LMLOD   LMLOB   LMLOM    LSIO   LSIOT   LSIOD   LSIOB   LSIOM    RCC   RCCT   RCCD   RCCB   RCCM    RFB   RFBT   RFBD   RFBB   RFBM    RISO   RISOT   RISOD   RISOB   RISOM    RLM   RLMT   RLMD   RLMB   RLMM    RML   RLMOT   RLMOD   RLMOB   RLMOM    RMLO   RMLT   RMLD   RMLB   RMLM    RSIO   RMLOT   RMLOD   RMLOB   RMLOM   

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The projection name shall be one present in a list that the AWS should have previously uploaded into \fBGantry\fP with the command \fBSET_ProjectionList\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Target Angle"
The target angle is the angle where actually the C-ARM shall be rotated\&.

.PP
The angle is set by the AWS based usually by the ACR views typical angles\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The AWS may change the angle associated to a projection name\&. 
.br
.RE
.PP
.SS "Acceptable Range"
The acceptable range parameter is set by the AWS so that a manual modification of the C-ARM angle cannot exceed a reasonable value that may loose the meaning of the projection name selected\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The operator may move the C-ARM in the full range with the manual button, but when the ARM should be out of the acceptable range, a WARNING message will be activated by the MCPU, preventing the possibilty to start an exposure\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Virtual Isocentric Correction"
Only with an Automatic activation and after the C-ARM rotation completion, the Vertical Motor will adjust (if necessary) the height of the Detector plane in order to keep the compression plane unchanged\&.

.PP
This feature, called \fBVirtual Isocentricity\fP, allows the operator to set the right position for the patient one time only for different projections\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The Height adjustment can happen only after the C-ARM rotation completion and only if this activation should successfully terminate\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Rotation speed in Automatic mode"
The rotation speed when in automatic mode is set in the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP\&.

.PP
\fBWarning\fP
.RS 4
Although the speed may be changed with the configuration file, it is discouraged if the modify is made by a non skilled personel\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Manual Positioning"
The C-ARM can be activate in manual mode in different scenarios:
.IP "\(bu" 2
In operating mode (Open Study contest) two manual buttons are asigned to the CW and CCW rotations;
.IP "\(bu" 2
In the manual zero setting service procedure, all the manual buttons and the Pedalboard pedals can activate the rotation in CW or CCW;
.IP "\(bu" 2
In the service rotation tool , all the manual buttons and the Pedalboard pedals can activate the rotation in CW or CCW;
.PP

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
When in manual zero setting procedure, the speed of the rotation is strongly reduced to help the fine ARM positioning to the mechanical zero\&.

.PP
The actual speed of the Manual rotation can be adjuted in the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP\&.

.PP
When in operating mode, the manual rotation shuld be executed only after a valid projection selection\&. Differently, this may be overriden by a further command from the AWS\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Zero Setting Calibration"
The zero setting procedure is necessary when:
.IP "\(bu" 2
After the first installation in Factory;
.IP "\(bu" 2
In case the C-ARM should be mechanically removed or rotated for service;
.IP "\(bu" 2
In case the MCPU software should be reinstalled and the \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP should be cancelled or overridden;
.IP "\(bu" 2
In case the configuraiton file should be corrupted;
.PP

.PP
The missing of the correct C-ARM position cannot be detected by the system automatically and may be visible by an evident discrepance from the projection angle and the effective angle\&.

.PP
In the case a zero setting procedure should be executed, a service tool is provided\&.

.PP
There are two possible zero setting procedures:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The automatic procedure;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The manual procedure;
.PP

.PP
When the automatic zero setting procedure is activated:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The motor driver executes a slow rotation until a photocell intercepts the mechanical zero point;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Internal encoder of the motor is then reset to zero;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP file is updated;
.PP

.PP
The manual zero setting position, differently by the automatic zero setting procedure, requires the manual activation of the C-ARM by pressing one of the enabled buttons\&.

.PP
The operator shall rotate the C-ARM in this way until the position reaches the expected mechanical zero point:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Internal encoder of the motor is then reset to zero;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBMotorCalibration\&.cnf configuration file\fP file is then updated;
.PP

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
the speed in the manual mode is reduced allowing to a fine zero positioning\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Motor Fault Management"
The motor driver handles an internal Diagnostics in order to detect malfunctions\&.

.PP
There are several fault conditions:
.IP "\(bu" 2
some of theme are repristinable;
.IP "\(bu" 2
other malfunctions, for theire inner nature, causes a permanent fault;
.PP

.PP
In case the Motor driver should detect a fault condition, the MCPU application will activate an ERROR message with the description of the signaled fault\&.

.PP
\fBAttention\fP
.RS 4
When the motor driver is in fault condition it internally disables the motor activation\&.
.br
The MCPU only monitors the status changing and, as soon as the fault condition should 
.br
 reset, it clears the error message\&.
.br
There is however an exception:
.IP "\(bu" 2
if the signaled fault is due to a thermal protection, the MCPU will remove the power to the motor and put the \fBGantry\fP out of service\&.
.PP
.RE
.PP
.SS "Safety Strategy"
The following safety strategy protects against injuries:
.IP "\(bu" 2
In Idle state (not in Open Study) the C-ARM rotation is disabled at all\&. 
.br

.PP

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
In Idle state, the \fBGantry\fP may be left unattended and consequently may be accidentally activated by non competent operators\&.
.RE
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
During a compression, the C-ARM activation is disabled;
.IP "\(bu" 2
In case of driver faut, The C-ARM activation is disabled;
.IP "\(bu" 2
During an Automatic rotation (AWS) every manual button or pedalboard activation stops the rotation;
.IP "\(bu" 2
During an Automatic rotation (AWS) the obstacle detection stops the rotation;
.IP "\(bu" 2
A picture with the projection Icon will result well visible on the Screen, remembering to the operator what is the current selected projection, and preventing a wrong breast placement;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The Acceptable range guarantee the coherence of the C-ARM angle respect the current expected exposure mode;
.PP
.SS "Motor Configuration process"
During the Application startup fase, after the communication with the motor driver is achieved and before to enter in an operatiing mode (where the motor can be activated), the application uploads the motor driver with all the necessary registers in order to tune the motor performances as expected\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
Not all the registers are modified during the startup: some register is runtime modified when the motor is activated by the application\&.
.RE
.PP
Because the C-ARM module inherits the Base Motor Module, most of the registers that this module uploads are the default of the base module\&. See the \fBMotor Configuration Process\fP for details

.PP
Here are reported only those registers that are specific for the C-ARM:

.PP
Register Address   Value   Description    0x3210:01   50000   Position Loop, Proportional Gain (closed Loop)    0x3210:02   10   Position Loop, Integral Gain (closed Loop)
