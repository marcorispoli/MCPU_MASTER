.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 


This section provides methods to monitor and control the Safety tools implemented in the \fBPCB301\fP board\&.
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP board implements hardware circuits in order to provides the system with a level of safety related to:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Emergency Input Line
.IP "\(bu" 2
Motor Rotation protection;
.IP "\(bu" 2
X-RAY execution protection;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Compressor activation;
.PP
.SH "Emergency Input"
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP board provides a dedicated hardware output to control the coil of the Main Contactor\&.
.br
The MainContactor is a power switch providing the power supply to the X-RAY generator and Motors\&.
.PP
The output is controlled with a series of dedicated inputs connected with the generator device and the Emergency button that can disable the coil activation in the following scenarios:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Emergency Push Button activation: if the operator should press one of predisposed emergency buttons the contactor is hardware disabled;
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBGenerator\fP initialization fase: during the initialization, the generator disables the AC power supply to prevent damages to its internal power circuit;
.PP
.PP
The status of the inputs line are monitored by the \fBPCB301\fP and passed to this module in order to be properly handled\&.
.SH "Open Cabinet Input"
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP board provides a dedicated hardware input line that, in case it should be open, disables the 48DVC power supply (used to power the motors)\&.
.PP
The input line should be connected to a series of cabinet switches that should prevent the unwanted motor activation when one of motor protection should be removed\&.
.PP
The status of the input is monitored by the \fBPCB301\fP and passed to this module in order to be properly handled\&. 
.br
.SH "Compression Detected Input"
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP board provides a dedicated hardware input line that, in case it should be activated, disables the Safety Solid State Relay 48DVC power supply (used to power a subset of motors);
.PP
The input line should be connected with the Compressor board (\fBPCB302\fP) that is responsible to detect the compression\&.
.PP
When the compression is present some motor shall be disabled to prevent a breast injury\&.
.PP
The status of the input is monitored by the \fBPCB301\fP and passed to this module in order to be properly handled\&. 
.br
.SH "Open Study Input"
.PP
This is a dedicated hardware input line that, in case it should be activated, prevents to activate the X-RAY enable signal of the \fBGenerator\fP device and, consequently, preventing to activate the X-RAY's\&.
.PP
This line should be connected to the Door of the Exposure Room to prevent unexpected entrance of persons during an exposure sequence\&.
.PP
The status of the input is monitored by the \fBPCB301\fP and passed to this module in order to be properly handled\&. 
.br
.SH "Compressor Enable Outputs"
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP board controls two dedicated output hardware lines to enable the compressor board (\fBPCB302\fP) to activate a compression on a breast or to calibrate the force measurement\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Compressor Enable Line: this line enables/disables the compressor motor to be activated;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Compressor Calibration Line: this line enables/disables the calibration procedure on the compressor device;
.PP
.PP
The compression activation should be disabled in the following conditions:
.IP "\(bu" 2
During an exposure to prevent to loose the current compression;
.IP "\(bu" 2
In case of system fault, to prevent an invalid compression activation;
.PP
.PP
The Calibration line should be activated only in service mode\&.
.PP
This module provides API's to control those output lines\&.
.SH "Burning Jumper Input"
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP allows to make use of an hardware jumper enabling the software activation of the X-RAY push Button line\&.
.PP
This feature is useful in production to activate special test procedures that can be executed in automatic mode without the operator\&.
.PP
This jumper however shall be removed when the System is set in operating condition for safety reason\&. If the jumper should be detected the System should prevent to enter in an operating mode\&.
.PP
In order to prevent an exposure event, this module activates a proper WARNING messagge when the jumper should be detected\&.
.PP
This module provides API to check the current status of the jumper detection status\&.
