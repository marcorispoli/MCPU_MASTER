.SH "Abstract"
.PP
This section describes the implementation of the modules controlling the \fBGantry\fP boards
.SH "Overview"
.PP
The \fBGantry\fP is equipped with several inbternal boards with microcontroller in order to execute specific realtime jobs\&.

.PP
The board are following listed:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBPCB301\fP board: this board controls the power supply and several system GPIOs ;
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBPCB302\fP board: this board controls the compressor device activities;
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBPCB303\fP board: this board controls the collimation device activities;
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBPCB304\fP board: this board controls the potter-grid device activities;
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBPCB325\fP board: this board controls the \fBBiopsy\fP ativities;
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBPCB326\fP board: this board controls the Obstacle detection activities;
.PP

.PP
All the devices supports the same protocol engine based on the Can Bus communication and a defined frame data exchange\&.

.PP
The protocol is desribed in the specific documentation\&.

.PP
This application implement a Base class (\fBCanDeviceProtocol\fP class) that implements all the communication mechanisms: each specific device module inherit this class as a base class\&. 
.PP
.nf
IMPORTANT: the protocol is common for all the devices in order to be a robust 
and well tested part of the module iplementation\&.

.PP
The basic features that all the modules inherit from this base class are:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Communication startup management:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Connection fase;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Remote Bootloader management;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Revision acquisition;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Device Register Configuration;
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Board reset handling;
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
High level routines to get and set the device registers;
.IP "\(bu" 2
High level routines to handle the command execution;
