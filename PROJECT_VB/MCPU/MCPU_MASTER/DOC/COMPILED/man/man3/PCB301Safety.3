.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 


This section provides methods to monitor and control the Safety tools implemented in the \fBPCB301\fP board\&.
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP board implements hardware circuits in order to provides the system with a level of safety related to:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Emergency Push Button Input Line
.IP "\(bu" 2
Motor Rotation protection;
.IP "\(bu" 2
X-RAY execution protection;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Compressor activation;
.PP
.SH "Emergency Input"
.PP
This is a dedicated hardware input line that, in case it should be open, disables:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
The external power contactor;
.IP "\(bu" 2
The external 48VDC power Supply (used to power the motors);
.PP
.SH "Open Cabinet Input Protection"
.PP
This is a dedicated hardware input line that, in case it should be open, disables the 48DVC power supply (used to power the motors);
.SH "Compression Pending Input"
.PP
This is a dedicated hardware input line that, in case it should be activated, disables the Safety Solid State Relay 48DVC power supply (used to power a subset of motors);
.SH "Open Study Input"
.PP
This is a dedicated hardware input line that, in case it should be activated, prevents to activate the X-RAY enable signal of the \fBGenerator\fP device and, consequently, preventing to activate the X-RAY's\&.
.SH "Compressor Activation"
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP board controls two dedicated hardware lines to enable the external compressor device to be activated or calibrated:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Compressor Enable Line: this line enables/disables the compressor motor to be activated;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Compressor Calibration Line: this line enables/disables the calibration procedure on the compressor device;
.PP
.PP
The compressor motor should be disabled in the following conditions:
.IP "\(bu" 2
During an exposure to prevent to loose the current compression;
.IP "\(bu" 2
In case of system fault, to prevent to allow an invalid compression to the patient;
.PP
.PP
The Calibration line should be activated only in service mode\&.
.PP
NOTE: the pcb301 and this module don't activate this lines directly\&. Other modules in this Application shall make use of the controlling methods\&.
.SH "Burning Jumper Detection"
.PP
The \fBPCB301\fP allows to makes use of a hardware jumper that enables the Application to activate the X-RAY push Button input via a software command\&.
.PP
This feature is useful in production to activate special test procedures that can be executed in automatic mode without the operator\&.
.PP
This jumper however shall be removed when the System is set in operating condition for safety reason\&. If the jumper should detcted present the System shall prevent to enter in an operating fase\&. 
.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "static bool PCB301::getBurningJumper (void)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
This function returns the status of the Burning Jumper detected presence  The jumper for the burning reduces the safety level of the \fBGantry\fP\&.
.PP
The jumper cannot be present in an operative session so the Application shall detect its presence for safety reason\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
True if the Jumper is detected present
.RE
.PP

.SS "static bool PCB301::getCabinetSafety (void)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
This function returns the Cabinet Safety Input circuit line activation status\&.  When this input is activated, the external 48VDC power supply is disabled for safety reasons\&.
.PP
The Application should use this method to properly handle the operativity and to provide the correct information to the operator\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
True: the cabinet input circuit is detected active
.RE
.PP

.SS "static bool PCB301::getCompressionStatus (void)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
This function returns the Compression Pending Status Input circuit line activation status\&.  When this input is activated, the external safety solid state relay is disabled and the Motor powered by this line cannot be activated for safety reasons\&.
.PP
The Application should use this method to properly handle the operativity and to provide the correct information to the operator\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
True: the compression line is detected active
.RE
.PP

.SS "static \fBdoor_options\fP PCB301::getDoorStatus (void)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
This function returns the Door Study Status Input circuit line activation status\&.  When this input is activated, the X-RAY enable signal is disabled and no X-RAY Radiation can be executed by the \fBGenerator\fP device\&.
.PP
The Application should use this method to properly handle the operativity and to provide the correct information to the operator\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
True: the study's door is detected open
.RE
.PP

.SS "static bool PCB301::getEmergency (void)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
This function returns the Emergency Input circuit line activation status\&.  When this input is activated, the external power contactor is switched off toghether with the 48VDC power supply\&.
.PP
The Application should use this method to properly handle the operativity and to provide the correct information to the operator\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
True: the emergency input has been detected activated
.RE
.PP

.SS "static void PCB301::SetCompressorCalib (bool stat)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
This method sets the Compressor Calibration Output line on the \fBPCB301\fP board\&.  The Compression Calibration output line enables/disables the activation of the force sensor of the copressor device\&.
