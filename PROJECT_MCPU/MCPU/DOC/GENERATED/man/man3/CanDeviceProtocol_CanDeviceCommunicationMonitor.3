.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This class provides an interface to monitor the communication performance with the device\&. 

Every frame is sent and after every message received, the internal statistic is updated with the following infos:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Tx-Rx mean time: this is the mean time of the time elapsed from the Tx event to the Rx event;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Perc5: this is the percentage of elapsed time less than 5ms;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Perc10: this is the percentage of elapsed time less than 10ms;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Perc15: this is the percentage of elapsed time less than 15ms;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Perc20: this is the percentage of elapsed time less than 20ms;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Perc25: this is the percentage of elapsed time less than 25ms;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Perc30: this is the percentage of elapsed time less than 30ms;
.IP "\(bu" 2
Percxx: this is the percentage of elapsed time exceeding 30ms;
.PP
.PP
The Statistics are updated every 100 messages\&.
